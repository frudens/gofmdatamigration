# goFMDataMigration

goFMDataMigration is a command line tool for easy data migration using the FMDataMigration tool. FileMaker is a trademark of FileMaker, Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.

## Intro

* Copy the source file of the production server to the `resources/prod` folder.
* Copy the development server's clone file to the `resources/clone` folder.
* Execution of the command will be saved in the `resources/migrated` folder.
* For example, `gofmdatamigration -a account -p password -k key -iv -ia -if`
* Note: [FMDataMigration](https://fmhelp.filemaker.com/docs/edition/en/migration/index.html) is required.

## Getting Started

1. You must have a [Go](http://golang.org) compiler installed.
2. Download [FMDataMigration](https://fmhelp.filemaker.com/docs/edition/en/migration/index.html) and move to the project folder.
3. Download and build goFMDataMigration: `go get github.com/frudens/gofmdatamigration`
4. Either copy the `gofmdatamigration` executable in `$GOPATH/bin` to a directory in
   your `PATH`, or add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH`.
5. Download the folder or file to be migrated from the production server and copy it to the `resources/prod` folder.
6. Prepare the clone file from the backup of the development server and copy it to the `resources/clone` folder.
7. Run `gofmdatamigration -a account -p password`
8. The same file as the prod folder is created in the `resources/migrated` folder.

## Usage

Create a folder for data migration.

```
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir goFMDataMigration
$ cd goFMDataMigration
$ pwd
/Users/user/Desktop/goFMDataMigration
```

Move or copy source and clone files.
The following is a sample.

```
$ tree
.
├── resources
│   ├── clone
│   │   ├── dir1
│   │   │   └── Inventory Clone.fmp12
│   │   ├── dir2
│   │   │   └── Meetings Clone.fmp12
│   │   ├── Contacts Clone.fmp12
│   │   └── Tasks Clone.fmp12
│   └── prod
│       ├── dir1
│       │   └── Inventory.fmp12

│       │   └── Meetings.fmp12
│       ├── Contacts.fmp12
│       └── Tasks.fmp12
└── FMDataMigration
```

Execute the command.

```
$ gofmdatamigration -a admin -p ""
